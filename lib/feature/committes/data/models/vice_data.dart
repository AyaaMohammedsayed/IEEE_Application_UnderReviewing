  experience: '''Throughout my journey in student activities, I’ve taken on diverse roles that enhanced my leadership, communication, and organizational skills. Currently, as HR Vice Head at IEEE Benha University SB, I conduct evaluations to assess progress and provide constructive feedback, assist with recruitment initiatives, and organize and manage the registration process for major events. During my tenure, I participated in organizing events such as MEPCON 2024, Hour of Code, and Robotics & AI Workshop 9.

Previously, I was an AI committee member at IEEE, gaining hands-on experience in AI, and served as PR & Fundraising Head at EIT, managing sponsorships and events. I also contributed as Vice-chair of the Arts Committee in the Student Union, an HR Specialist at EIT, and a Social Media Specialist at Shoubra Creators.

I believe these experiences have equipped me with skills that will benefit my professional career. Working in different roles has taught me how to manage teams, coordinate projects, and adapt to challenges, preparing me to excel in dynamic work environments.
